# unity-IAD-and-shaders

This repository has a collection of selected code from my solo indie 2D game **Into A Dream** ([Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238360/Into_A_Dream/)), as well as a collection of 2D and 3D shaders that I have **found** (*public*), **modified** or **written**. Credit to [Harry Alisavakis](https://halisavakis.com/category/blog-posts/my-take-on-shaders/) for the incredible tutorials, from which I learnt and modified most of my 3D shaders.

The repository comprises of three folders:

* **Shaders** - Compilation of 3D shaders for multiple uses, such as Skyboxes, Image Effects, Depth, Water and more;
* **Shaders_2D** - Compilation of 2D shaders that were used in Into a Dream - Water, Distortion, Glitch, Dissolve and more;
* **Systems_and-Controls** - Selection of classes used for Into A Dream - AudioManager, SaveSystem, DialogueManager, PlayerController. Folder *3D_AnimationControl_HeadTurn* has code to be used with a 3D character model using Animator, that overrides the head position and rotation from the animation with staring to certain objects (added as public variables) when near them;

All code is free to be used and modified for own purposes.
